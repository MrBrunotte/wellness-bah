# Project name: Wellnes Bahamas
This is a website that is made for Ruth Brunotte, who is a Plant-Based Health Neuktritionist and a Sivanand Yoga Instructor. She lives in Nassau Bahamas and offers consultation in plant-based living, courses for preparing and cooking vegan och vegetarian meals. 
The purpose of the website is for her to have a comunication channel to attract new customers, interact with her clients and promote herself.
The website is under construction and is subject to modification in the future.
## UX
This website is for Ruth Brunotte who wants to start her own business in the Bahamas. She wants to help people acheive better health by following a plant-based diet and eating less dairy and meat products.
The typical user is someone who wants a change in their life. It might be because of disease or something else. When the potential client finds the website he/she should be attracted by the landingpage/wellness page. By using less option for the user to interact with the aim is to direct the user towards the courses och coaching section where they can sign up.

The navbar is fixed to the top so it always is reachable. And it is always possible for the user to easily go back to the landingpage/wellness page.

The sign up/courses/coaching pages all have a home button for easy access.
## Features
